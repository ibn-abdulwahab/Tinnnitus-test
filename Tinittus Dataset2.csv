After doing some research on some alternative options I decided to give audiocardio a try. I have to say," I am really surprised and impressed on how much a difference it has already made. I recently went to a restaurant and noticed I was picking up sounds a lot better than before,  conversations weren’t as muffled. Definitely give this app a shot,  especially if you are looking for a cheaper alternative. Best thing is that I can do the sound therapy whenever I want.",", ",positive,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/1983135-audiocardio-hearing-test/reviews/2881607631/reply,,"""""Audio"""", """"Bugs"""", """"Satisfied users"""", """"Use cases""""]"",","],",]

Been trying for it for sometime and trying to see if it makes a difference. So far haven’t seen a difference but will continue. Don’t like it that it is a paid subscription and not that cheap. Updated and lowered my rating since I found a few bugs with the app. Have sent those bugs to the company hopefully they can resolve it. But for the paid subscription would think it should be less or free if essentially we are beta’ing the app. Update April 10, 2022. So got email from developer. App still has a few bugs and hope they can fix it soon.  Updated my review from 2 to 3 since app developers seem to really want to fix their product and are receptive to feedback.  But for price would think their main part of volume control should be fixed since this is main part of the therapy. Hopefully it works in future will try again once app is more  stable with bugs fixed.  Concept and practice seems to be easy and straight forward and hopefully it can help with hearing loss and tinnitus.,", ",negative,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/1983135-audiocardio-hearing-test/reviews/2881607665/reply,,"""""Audio"""", """"Bugs"""", """"Complexity"""", """"Notifications & Alerts"""", """"Performance"""", """"Pricing"""", """"Customer Support"""", """"Use cases""""]"",","],",]

I developed sudden tonal tinnitus at the age of 57 with a pitch of around 8,"000 mhz.  While I use AudioCardio every day for at least an hour,  I don’t really think it has improved my hearing…though perhaps it has helped me maintain where I am.  However,  I do believe it has worked to calm my tinnitus significantly.  There is something about those tones that seem like maybe they stimulate something in my ear/brain that decreases the tinnitus volume. There are still some days where it is louder and more distracting and I will listen to the audio cardio more on those days – and eventually it seems to quiet things down.  I am appreciative of this app for sure as there aren’t many consistent ways to affect tinnitus.

However,  if you were to charge one or two dollars for the ability to save results,  I would,  without hesitation,  pay for that ability just because of the professional results,  ease of use and my appreciation of both.

I suggest making it clear where to download more sounds," and where the downloaded sounds go.  Putting tab view inside a sheet is weird. It makes navigating the app harder than necessary.  The sleep timer still looks like a blog from 2004 that the owner thinks having gif as a background will make the homepage look more fancy. It could look better,  especially the buttons.  The catalogue has various types of sound,  but the niche ones only have one sound/preset. I’d be very happy if there are more. The image on the first screen,  I don’t know why it’s there. It serves very little purpose,  in my opinion.  Lastly,  I like the price. Very affordable.

Some of the backgrounds are glitchy when the screen is rotated or otherwise interacted with,  which needs fixing.

Infinite Storm: Rain Sounds,iOS,Infinite Storm: Rain Sounds,iOS,576664798,4880725938,Australia,7.11,5,04/10/2019,Special Agent Sunshine,Version 7.11: great app + how to make it better,Note: This review is based on the free version. PROS: Plenty of options about the type of rain to listen to. Plus other sounds like white noise and urban sounds. The control centre is excellent," especially the “Recently Played” feature. I like the free “Featured Sounds” that can be downloaded to the “My Sounds” tab. The developer responds to reviews with info about what could be in a new version. Regular updates to squash bugs and improve the app (e.g. restoring the app’s ability to change orientation,  fixing the Fade Out Timer bug) - so many improvements in version 7.00 that I increased my rating from 3 stars to 5 stars. HOW TO MAKE IT BETTER: Add the option of an all-black background picture so that the iPad won’t emit any light while the app is on. Add the ability to tap on the background picture to toggle the control panel,  instead of having to swipe the control panel down or tap on a small icon. Space out the buttons and increase their size so that it’s not so easy to tap the wrong button. Add the option to download the “Classic Presets” so that they’re on the “My Sounds” tab. In the “My Sounds” tab,  tapping the three-dot-icon gives us only one option: deleting the sound. In that case,  change it to a trashcan-icon. The Fade Out Timer is awful - instead of only setting the finish time,  it should also offer big buttons with lengths of time - 1 hour,  10 minutes,  1 minute - so that the timer can be set quickly and easily. Add the ability to set sound-pictures as our favourites so that they show up near the top of the screen. Add the ability to save the current settings,  so that we don’t have to adjust them every time. CONCLUSION: The most-improved app that I’ve used in 2019. A great app,  with a little room for improvement. If you liked this review,  please long-press it and mark it as “helpful.”",", ",mixed,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/74157-infinite-storm-rain-sounds/reviews/2883095262/reply,,"""""Audio"""", """"Bugs"""", """"Camera & Photos"""", """"Complexity"""", """"Design & UX"""", """"Frequency"""", """"Gaming"""", """"Performance"""", """"Pricing"""", """"Satisfied users"""", """"Use cases"""", """"Devices""""]"",","],",]

I like that you can manipulate the sounds and mix them to make your own specific sounds. It comes with a handful and a few others a free to download. There are a lot more you can download if you pay.

I downloaded a few apps,  and this one was the absolute winner.

I need to move my phone around a bit to find the right position where I don’t hear the tone from the app or the ringing in my ear. It’s amazing; experts say it is impossible to use anti-noise,  because tinnitus isn’t a real sound,  but this absolutely works for me.

The way the background noise is tuned to your tinnitus specifically is amazing- I’ve also used the in app to show others in my life exactly what my tinnitus sounds like,  which helps me feel less isolated in dealing with this.

I tried a few different things but the only one that has reduced the loudness is by undergoing CBT and breathing exercises through this app. I couldn’t go to my parents house as it was too quiet and so my tinnitus would be uncomfortably loud. Now I can happily say I can go and spend time there and the tinnitus doesn’t bother me. I forget I have it now most of the time. Obviously the journey is different for everyone but I have most definitely seen an improvement.  Benefits of the platform: If you have any questions there is a chat function and someone will get back to you really quickly which I found very helpful during a spike period and I first downloaded the app There are loads of different exercises and types of exercise so I pick and choose what I feel like doing that day. The variety is great. Unlike some other meditation apps this tries to treat tinnitus through a number of different angles The sessions aren’t too long so I like to fit in a couple short ones a day which is helpful if you’re busy! About 5-8 minutes. Lili," who guides you through the exercises has a very calming voice  There are masks and sleep stories for anyone wanting to use the masking technique  There is also support for hyperacusis which I also developed which ultimately led to me getting the app. I can say that has gone aswell.  Sometimes I think its too good to be true that something as simple as CBT and breathing can make such a difference. But every time I stop using the app for a few weeks I notice the tinnitus and hyperacusis creeping back. Then I start the exercises again and they go.  The benefits of these practices are also great for anyone who suffers from anxiety and stress. Sometimes if something is stressing my out I’ll use the CBT techniques I’ve learnt here on those instead of the tinnitus. So you’re giving yourself the ability to overcome anything that’s holding you back in life,  which is a superpower really.

But...,I randomly stumbled upon this app when going down a rabbit hole on the app store," bored just scrolling to see what cool apps were featured these days. After downloading & opening I was amazed to see an app like this,  seeing nothing of its kind before. I think it’s brilliant,  beautiful,  & can definitely be quite helpful to many people for lots of reasons. However,  my only reason for giving 4 stars is due to the limited access of features the app offers when using the basic version (meaning not paying a subscription for the premium version). I know we live in a capitalist world,  nothing is ever totally free & also understand we utilize our creative skills to find ways to generate ourselves a living. Majority of apps these days have in app purchases & / or subscription options,  some charging more or less than others as well as some apps offering more or less features with/without subscribing for the premium access. This is totally fine considering for most apps this is just an option however,  I just wish this app in particular offered just a little bit more for the basic/free version. Mainly considering for #1 how it can be more helpful to many people rather than just your typical leisure app like game apps & #2 the cost of everything just seems to keep rising right now in 2022 hence $ is tight for many’s basic necessities let alone app subscriptions (especially considering i mentioned nearly every app either already costs $ or requires a subscription for many of some apps features).",", ",neutral,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/2010100-portal-immersive-escapes/reviews/2880687715/reply,,"""""Design & UX"""", """"Feature Requests"""", """"Payment"""", """"Pricing"""", """"Satisfied users"""", """"Update""""]"",","],",]

I wanted something soothing to play through the night. I tried a few relaxation apps and they were all fine with their white noise and raindrops,  but nothing really captivated me.  Then after seeing it come up so many times in my App Store searches,  I tried Portal. Wow! Seriously WOW! These sounds are gorgeous! So rich,  dimensional and lush! The visuals so cinematic! I would fire up a thunderstorm or windswept mountain peak and let my mind drift off.  I liked the free offerings so much I tried the 7-day free trial and fell in love with several of the subscription soundscapes. But that price! As tempted as I was,  I just couldn’t bring myself to spend that much right now. It was the $25 offer pop-up that convinced me to go for it. I’ve since started using the app to help me focus while reading,  tried it with my headphones,  and just tried one of the breathing exercises! It’s truly impressive! The developers have clearly put a lot of thought and effort into to making sure this isn’t just another cute collection of nature sounds.  My only quibble is the price. To be fair,  the developers acknowledge not everybody can afford this and don’t just brush off criticism with an “If you don’t want to pay,  go somewhere else” attitude. Definitely a plus in my book.  I’d love to see a smart TV app in the future,  as the immersive sound and stunning visuals would be perfect for the medium.  Whether you can afford a subscription or not,  I highly encourage anyone looking for a relaxation app to give this one a shot.

Obviously"," blind and visually impaired people like me would benefit from the sound,  and not so much the visuals,  but even then,  the app is still awesome. For anyone who doesn't know what voiceover is,  voiceover is an accessibility feature of iOS that speaks items on the screen,  as well as changing how the device works,  so that blind and visually impaired people can use the touchscreen. Probably one of the most important things to know about VoiceOver is that you touch an item on the screen to have voiceover speak that item,  and when it has spoken the item you want to activate,  then you double tap quickly anywhere on the screen to activate that item on the screen. Anyone can probably learn more about this by going to settings,  accessibility,  voiceover,  and then clicking on the voice over practice icon. In order for a certain app to work correctly with voiceover,  certain parts of the app need to be programmed in a specific way. Unfortunately,  this is where this app that I'm reviewing here lags behind,  which is why I am giving it four stars instead of five. There are some areas of this app that work better with voiceover than other areas of this app,  however,  areas where this app does not seem to work with voiceover include areas like finding and activating the button to set alarms. Also,  the actual process of changing the time for the alarm is inaccessible as well,  however,  maybe,  that could've been resolved if the setting to change from an analog clock to a digital clock changed that when setting alarms as well rather than just changing that for viewing the clock on the main screen. Despite certain features not working for me due to inaccessibility with voiceover,  I can still enjoy opening a Portal whenever I want,  and turning it off whenever I'm done. I would imagine that typical users of the app would swipe left and right to go between portals,  and swipe up to close the portals. Some thing that surprised me about voiceover was that I was able to double tap and drag left and right to go between portals,  as well as double tapping and dragging upward to close the portals. Not all apps seem to handle that kind of scenario with voice over in the same way. Overall,  I still think this is a great app,  because it is pretty unique.",", , mixed",,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/2010100-portal-immersive-escapes/reviews/2611912983/reply,,"],","],",]

The scenes are really beautiful,  and more immersive than a typical relaxation app.  I was even very pleasantly surprised to see a local location (for me,  Oregon,  USA) included. The interface menu is well thought out as well,  even giving you a long (if not complete) preview of each of the lengthy,  well looped,  video dynamic themes,  including their soundscapes. When I’d started up Portal today,  I was met with announcement that there had been a large update,  which included more scenes,  a “favorites, ” function,  etc. Again,  very pleased! I honestly don’t think I could realistically ask for much more from this app. Mac version and an Android version would be a dream,  though,  frankly,  my outdated iMac probably wouldn’t even be compatible. Although I’m absolutely happy with current version,  as my experience has been so rewarding,  I’m keen to see what’s next.

First of all - it is a long time since i installed another app besides my all-time classic MyNoise,  which is an excellent app,  too. But yours has a feature MyNoise is missing. Immersive and truly beautiful videos to go along with the sounds. But i think you can build upon the video-aspect of your app a little more. I am a psychologist with a counselling office. I can imagine hanging a screen on the wall,  playing your sounds and showing your amazing videos to calm down patients before the session. But the videos you provide are really too short and repeat themselves much too early. Maybe you can add more and extended footage? Longer videoloops lasting at minimum minutes per portal will enhance the immersion of the app by miles. I think it could be an option - or an in-app purchase for those who want spend more time with this feature.  What do you think about that? Is it feasible?

The nature sounds are so calming,  & they easily calm me down when I’m angry or stressed. I mostly use it for sleep though. I have trouble sleeping,  so the nature noises along with the music I put on really helps. It drowns out the silence when one of the songs ends & a new one begins. I’d love to buy the premium—the ocean sounds are probably my favorite of them all—but I still have to convince my parents to let me buy it. ?? They typically aren’t the kind of people that buy whatever they... There are a few things I’d like to address about certain features. I’ve been having a slight issue with the mixing feature. I have an alarm separate from this app that goes off in the mornings. Lately,  I’ve been sleeping in (but don’t tell anyone.??) I’ve been noticed that the nature sounds don’t ever continue playing after the alarm sounds. Well,  they’re playing,  but not playing? I have another alarm that goes off during the day,  and the ambiance start randomly playing. I’m not sure if this is a glitch or if it’s my phone,  but it’s slightly annoying. Can you also make it so you can adjust the volume? I know that’s already a feature,  but I can barely hear your audio over the playlist I use,  & if I turn my phone volume up,  it turns both of the volumes up,  which doesn’t really help. I don’t have a way of turning my playlists volume down,  & the ambiance’s volume is already at the max. Could you please do something about this? Despite those two things,  this is an amazing app! I definitely recommend it for help sleeping & relaxing! ?Thanks for readying!!??",", ",positive,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/2010100-portal-immersive-escapes/reviews/1794808668/reply,,"""""Audio"""", """"Bugs"""", """"Feature Requests"""", """"Gaming"""", """"Notifications & Alerts"""", """"Pricing"""", """"Satisfied users"""", """"Customer Support"""", """"Use cases""""]"",","],",]

Would recommend to everyone and use it every night as a screen saver on both my phone and my iPad. Love having the gentle sound of a fire or waves in my room during the day and the beautiful live videos are brilliant for screensavers when not working with the device. I instantly purchased the upgrade for the rest of the portals because I NEEDED the others because the base ones were incredible. My only additions I'd make to the app is that I'd love a feature where the clock is the only UI piece on the screen as would love to wake up to see time and not the bottom UI, i would love to see more features added to the connectivity such as google home support and also maybe a way to choose a playlist of portals to play for different durations I would also love to see in the future a way to have this on my windows PC although this is an IOS app it would be superb on PC too! But that's just me with my ideas lol this app is a must download and I yesss it all the time! I can't get enough of this app! I can't wait to see what portals will be coming soon!

Last one I wrote was when I had my iPod touch 2nd gen. But I had to leave something here for this one. First," this is the perfect meditation app I’ve been looking for. For $4,  and no other in app purchases,  it’s extremely simple and accessible. Second,  the addition of timers and allowing external sounds for other tasks is wonderful. I set a 20 minute timer in the app and played the thunderstorm sound and got lost in my head. It was a wonderful break from a time like this. I even fell asleep sitting in my chair briefly. I’m a 20 year old student who is also working and am constantly overwhelmed with everything going on in my life. This was the best experience I’ve had in a while and hope to keep using this app. I love it. Simple. Clean. Easy. Great work guys. Keep it the same please. I don’t need any other features,  just hope more people use it. On second thought,  here are a few feature ideas I want to add: 1. The ability to create and share our own looping sounds on a “workshop”. #NAME? #NAME? #NAME? #NAME? #NAME? #NAME? 2. More options for the timer alarm on “escape” or other modes. #NAME? #NAME?

I love all the features without it being convoluted. The app itself has a beautiful layout that makes it easy to navigate. One aspect I really enjoyed was the breathing exercise. Originally I downloaded this for the sounds which can help me find calm as I’m falling asleep or when I’m relaxing reading a book, but the fact that it had a breathing exercise in addition to that was a nice feature. I feel most apps either have one thing I need and missing the other when it comes to calm and relaxation. I don’t feel calm or relaxed by listening to voices compared to many other apps out there for similar techniques.

Its been years since Ive found new one worth keeping,  so thankyou to developers for not charging crazy prices weekly and monthly just to listen to nature! As to the app itself,  the sounds are realistic,  light,  and they play with other audio AND have seperate volume control,  everything I look for in a sounds app! I love the gentle waves in the beach one and the soothing ocean sound in the pacific ocean,  they are smooth and blend well in background with other apps,  not to over powering.  I would love to see more choices added in future,  maybe some soft white noise and/or drone as white noise,  and more gentle river,  stream,  and water/wave ones without added birds ect...with them.  A suggested feature would be to allow mixing these sounds,  or ability to customize them (like add or take out the birds and added ambience per scene) I personally just like the main sound,  the river or ocean or wind,  without the added nature,  so I only use the 3 that are simple for now. Overall I love it and was worth the $4 to own and even more to know I can always use it without stressing over paying for it every week or month to do so. I truly hope the developers keep updated it and added new scenes and features without taking away how well it works (wich so far they have been", so thankyou!) and id love to see more apps from these developers ;) -Michelle,,,positive,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/2010100-portal-immersive-escapes/reviews/1760463152/reply,,"""""Audio"""", """"Complexity"""", """"Design & UX"""", """"Feature Requests"""", """"Payment"""", """"Performance"""", """"Pricing"""", """"Satisfied users"""", """"Stre"

Right off the bat," the app’s appearance is sleek,  modern,  and overall gorgeous. The UI is seamless and allows for quick jumping between environments. The visuals alone are enough to strike awe in any user,  with pristine living landscapes that unfurl with just a swipe or two of your finger. Then there’s the sound... absolutely stunning. The audio within each portal is crisp and clear. As another user mentioned,  it’s very difficult to recognize where the audio loops,  making it incredibly wonderful to use when working or going to sleep. I have found that other ambiance apps or sound machines simply do not have enough variety in their sounds or have audio that too clearly loops banal,  short,  overused sound clips. Overall,  this app stands well above the rest,  with absolutely beautiful audio and visual elements that transport the user around the globe with just a few swipes of the finger. A few additional notes: I have the full version of the app (after paying for the small in-app purchase to unlock the rest of the sounds) and can definitely say it is worth it.  I love the idea of connecting with a smart light to change the whole ambiance of the room. I have one smart light in a lamp that I was hoping to use with the app,  but unfortunately it requires a philips hub,  which I do not have. That being said,  it is not difficult to assign the portals to custom colors in the Philips Bluetooth app. Though I love the app as it is,  I want to just second the suggestion,  brought up by another user,  to add at least one portal with an urban environment.  Thank you developers for the incredible app!

Especially once you open up the full library,  the sounds it provides are amazing and perfect for helping you focus or escape. All of it’s sounds are amazing and I’ve gotten a real boost in efficiency thanks to the app. My only wish is for more sounds. The 14 they provide are all very effective and neat,  but I’m very tempted to ask for more. For instance: they provide mainly nature sounds form around the world.

I’ve been looking for a decent app that plays sound like this for awhile. It helps me to sleep or really focus when I am studying. Some of the other apps just haven’t done it for me,  and while searching for a new one I found Portal. You get a few “portal’s” for free,  but have to purchase the rest. For me,  this wasn’t an issue. I happily paid the $3.99 to unlock all the features as a one-time payment. Some apps make you pay for each separately,  so it was nice to only have to pay once to unlock it all. The sounds are so crystal clear and sound great. The look and feel of the app is also very nice. You can hook it up to philips hue lights which I don’t have yet,  but plan on buying in the future so I think that will be cool. I really only have one complaint. In the portals there is a guided breathing exercise,  and it tells you on the screen when to breathe in and out. I really wish there was a way to have it narrated for you. Sometimes I like to close my eyes when doing breathing exercises and obviously I can’t see the screen when my eyes are closed. Other then that,  this app is awesome! 5 stars for sure.

More sounds," more options for sounds,  and an AMAZING feature that allows the sound from the app play on top of sounds from other apps. This means I can use meditation apps alongside the soundscapes from Portal.  The new sounds are incredible. The update was only released yesterday,  so I have only used the new update for one mediation sitting - but I’m blown away.  This is a great update and the app is now terrific value for money. Quality work from the developers.

While his character is just standing there having the random pet or person walk up to her. :). I absolutely believe that this app has already been worth every cent of the money I decided to spend.

Certainly,  the idea has been revolutionary and it has helped many people,  which I think is commendable.  However,  anyone interested in getting that therapy should know that it costs 5, 000-6, 000 dollars presently,  it is not covered by insurance,  and requires a one year commitment (it apparently takes around 3-6 months to notice any results at all).  With it being way out of my price range,  I decided to give Julian's approach a try,  and honestly,  the results I have gotten from just 6-7 WEEKS of Julian's treatment have probably given me about the result I would have gotten from about 6-8 MONTHS of TRT; it just took way less time and was way cheaper.  I paid about 180 dollars for two sessions with Julian,  and a few hundred for craniosacral therapy.  That was it.  The exercises cost nothing,  and the yoga DVD was what,  20 bucks?  Also,  TRT does not actually cure tinnitus,  it only helps manage the condition.  Julian's approach CAN eliminate tinnitus entirely,  as I have eliminated the tinnitus in my left ear since using his approach.  So,  Julian's approach is cheaper,  takes less time,  and seems capable of ridding me of the tinnitus in my right ear as well.  With all due respect to TRT,  this is simply a no-brainer,  especially for those who are on a tight budget.",", ",mixed,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/2193997-quieten-tinnitus-relief/reviews/2771212721/reply,,"""""Payment"""", """"Pricing"""", """"Satisfied users""""]"",","],",]

Recently I discovered Quieten. I started using it this month with a new client who had consulted several other doctors before he came to see me. He was in a highly agitated state,  unable to sleep more than two hours a night due to what he called “the screaming in my ears.“ In addition,  he was having panic attacks and was more claustrophobic than ever. I recommended Quieten along with some breathing and mindfulness exercises. We recently had our fourth visit,  and the patient now affirms that he is able to sleep soundly (and he has Fitbit data to corroborate that). Moreover,  he has had no panic attacks and was able to undergo an MRI procedure without claustrophobic interference. To use his words,  Quieten has been “a lifesaver.“ I heartily applaud Julian Cowan Hill for this extraordinary addition to our clinical tool kit.",", ",positive,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/2193997-quieten-tinnitus-relief/reviews/2771212936/reply,,"""""Bugs"""", """"Design & UX"""", """"Satisfied users"""", """"Customer Support"""", """"Use cases""""]"",","],",]

I believe non-subscribers can use some of the sounds. In my opinion,  one quality that sets this app apart from perhaps others is the list of sounds (there’s quite a few) and how authentic they sound,  and now and then a new one is listed. My VERY favorite part of the app is the blending of the sounds. The creator of the app has mixes he has made if you want to use them,  but you can create your own mixes,  and I believe you can blend up to 4 at-a-time. Then,  you can remove or add them one-at-a-time with just a click. My favorite blend is rain (original) and rain on a tent. I have it begin at bedtime every night automatically. At times,  I add the sound of the vinyl record going around and around,  but a relative said it sounded like a merry go ‘round at a spooky amusement park and she couldn’t sleep listening to it. Me? It made me think of playing vinyl records growing up (have a large collection now) and music boxes I loved as a child. Anyway,  there are sounds for everyone’s likes and wants. I prefer this app from a smaller businessperson to those from larger businesses or corporations as I enjoy supporting such,  which brings me to my last point… the support is awesome,  usually prompt and friendly.

Every night I plug in my under-pillow speaker,  turn on Rain Rain,  and awake to the morning lighting up the forest through my window.  So 10 years ago I contacted a fungal disease which wiped me out making sleep something I no longer did. I would put a book-on-tape playing just to fill the space in my mind,  taking it off “I’m not sleeping”,  but I would continue to wake up with the book rattling on. A friend suggested white noise,  I tried a couple apps but the sounds were tin-like and repetitive,  not soothing. I decided to try one more,  which turned out being Rain Rain. For all of us that need a little hook,  push,  diversion to enter rest; this is it. It won’t disappoint. (Ok,  now I can sleep.

They must be on l-o-n-g loops because I don’t ever notice a repetition. I particularly like Rain Rain’s customizing features. For example,  I wanted the rhythmic sound of a Pullman sleeping car,  but Rain Rain’s “Train” sound was too light on the rhythmic rail sound and the train whistle blew a crossing signal too loudly and too often for me. So,  I mixed “Train” with “Washing Machine, ” softened both,  cut the volume of “Train” a bit,  and put the “Train” half on slowest oscillate. The result,  which I named “Pullman Car, ” makes it sound to me like I’m in a sleeping car 10 or so cars behind the engine and with far fewer and softer crossing signals from the train whistle. My favorite mix — puts me to sleep in a few minutes. This is a truly great app with SUPER-well-thought-out features. Rain Rain deserves maximum stars for sure — I’d give it 10,  if I could.

A friend told me about an app that provided background sounds to help ease me into sleep. HA! I scoffed! But decided to give it a try! People were beginning to comment on dark circles," asking if I was ill,  etc so OK I’ll give it a try! So I did! After trying SEVERAL different apps I found the ONE that offers the MOST VARIETY for the BEST PRICE! Rain,  Rain really does the trick for me!! I soon remembered how well I always slept with my window open during a summer thunderstorm!! Most of these apps offer a basic set of sounds & functions free with additional sounds & functions at an additional cost or yearly fee,  as does this app BUT the basic offerings are outstanding and better than the others I tried. Offered free is a wide variety of sounds including water sounds,  weather,  animals,  people/places,  music and a featured Premium sound every day PLUS night mode,  go to bed reminder,  fade out timer and MORE!! I MAY go premium at some point as the cost is very reasonable but for now I am DELIGHTED with the app as is! I haven’t even listened to HALF the sounds/music offered! Save yourself all the downloads and go straight to Rain,  Rain. I usually don’t do reviews unless it’s something special & since there are so many apps LIKE this offered a review is warranted.

The Highest Quality App on My Phone.,I have been using Rain Rain for almost 3 years," and I have always loved it so much. All the sounds feel so real and high quality,  and I never hear them loop,  so it truly feels like they are there. If you are someone who likes having a certain noise on while sleeping,  there is so much more than just rain sounds. There are fire cracking,  trains,  animal noises,  air vents,  all sorts of random things that all come together for anyone who is into that sort of thing. Another thing to mention is there are NO ADS. This is such an amazing gift of this app,  I can’t tell you how many times i’ve gotten home,  been tired as all hell,  and just laid down,  opened the app up,  and started playing my sounds and just passed out. If there were ads,  I would have to awkwardly wait while an ad plays during the middle of the night,  which would be the worst when you just want to go to sleep. The user interface is truly stellar. The app automatically sets the sounds you had selected last,  so all you have to do is just hit a button and sleep! Not to mention you can pick 3 sounds at a time. I love this,  certain sounds mix so well it feels like you’re really there. I also really love how premium sounds work. You get one premium sound a day,  or you can purchase them. I love this,  as I like the surprise of some nights before bed getting on and being excited for what new sound i’ll get. You can also sample any sound before you buy it,  so you know if you want it. I think this really shows how this app genuinely cares for your sleep,  not just to make money. I am all for this,  as I find myself constantly questioning every company and whatever they provide,  always asking myself,  “Where’s the catch?” Well,  i’m happy to say that in Rain Rain,  there is no catch. It’s just pure,  100% sounds. I’m going to continue to use this app for as long as I can,  and I hope to whoever is reading this,  that you can find as much enjoyment in this app that I have over the years. I am so happy to have this in my life!",", ",neutral,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/96313-rain-rain-sleep-sounds/reviews/1378868028/reply,,"""""Advertising"""", """"Audio"""", """"Design & UX"""", """"Pricing"""", """"Satisfied users"""", """"Use cases""""]"",","],",]

This happens even when the phone itself has NO other apps open,  is NOT disturbed or interrupted by anything,  NOT even TOUCHED,  in fact,  (being in airplane mode w/ notifications,  WiFi and BT all turned OFF, ) and connected to an Apple charger plugged in to an AC outlet by an Apple Lightning cable.

On airplanes,  in hotels,  at friends house,  anywhere!!! I will have this mix in my ears if I’m sleeping. The timer feature is super nice too - I have to set it to turn off before my alarms goes off or else I’ll have too much trouble waking up as this is basically melatonin for me now ???? I also love that the timer automatically applies the last used setting so that I don’t forget to set it every night - because I WILL sleep through my alarm otherwise.

My doc finally said enough,  no more meds! I safely stopped using them,  but,  sleep is elusive.  Before I found Rain Rain I had tried a number of other sleep sounds apps or Pandora.  Music is great,  but I tended to listen to the music rather than sleeping. Other sleep app sounds were mostly variations on a theme of static.  Rain Rain sounds real. My favorite water sounds are soothing.  What I enjoy the most about Rain Rain is the variety of choices of sounds to pick from!  I have lots of great choices for the most appropriate sounds for me.  Listening to only one sound every night tends to irritate the part of my brain that needs to be calmed.

About four years ago," I was on vacation in a house that was way too quiet for my liking. I quickly searched up sound machine apps,  and among them was Rain Rain. Now for many nights I went between the different apps,  trying to find something that fit everything I wanted,  specifically to customize the sound I wanted. No other app did but Rain Rain.

I’ve used Rain Rain App for a long time & loved falling asleep to the sounds of rain. There are many different sounds both free & premium that I’ve favourited.  My absolute favourite is ‘Car in the Rain’. I use a few different rain sound apps & always keep coming back to this one! This App was already five stars in my mind but I had one slight issue - I’m sensitive to high frequency sounds. This was common across all apps so I never made mention of it until now.  The latest update today included a slider to filter out high frequencies! This feature alone added the sixth star! Another new feature I’ll make use of is the ‘Suggest a Sound’. I’ll take my time because there’s already a terrific list to choose from. I’m not a fan of subscription services but I’m very happy the developer has included both one-off payments," as well as subscription services,  to satisfy everyone’s payment styles & listening choices. There are enough quality free sounds,  supported by small ads appearing at the bottom of the app,  to satisfy anyone who’s on a tight budget. Add a few relatively cheap premium sounds & you’ve got a very good selection. I highly recommend this app. Its in active development & the developer is committed to refining a very polished product. ????????????

You can have the app on in the background while you play music and adjust the levels to get that perfect rainy mood," as well as pick,  choose and mix sounds. The app has adjustable timers but otherwise continues playing with no audio ads with pretty minimal battery usage. Boasts a huge range of not just rain sounds,  but ambient noises like cafes,  summer ambience,  chimes and more. My only grievance is the premium tokens and subscription-based premium content. I’d much rather pay for a premium version of the app with all the sounds unlocked once than either pay for tokens separately or on a monthly subscription ($6 p/m).

We live on a busy road so the cars basically run back and fourth all night and it’s hard to sleep. I’ve used this app on and off going on 6 years now. Over my time with it," the improvements on the app display,  sounds and now the ability to mix two together is outstanding. I love the alerts for bedtime reminders it makes me feel like someone is making sure that I’m gonna be on track for the next day. With that being said though,  I wish there was a little more verity in what the alerts say because I use it 4 times a week and it kinda stinks that they repeat although they are very positive. Keep up the work team! I’m glad you all have been able to improve this app and I hope soon the reminders will have more verity.

I’ve struggled with periods of insomnia and Rain," Rain has always been there with its array of home appliance sounds,  that take me back to our apartment growing up,  or let me make a mix mimicing a windy storm battering against my window. The ‘premium’ sounds aren’t really more than a soft cap- the essentials are all available from the beginning and I’ve been given free premium unlocks numerous times. It’s incredible to have hooked up to speakers or bluetooth and I’ve always been able to get music to play simultaneously.

It started because some nights I felt anxious and just needed something to listen to to calm me down. Then I fell even more in love with it when they added train sounds. I lived in an apartment right by a train and when I would go to my parents for a night or two it was a nice reminder of my home. Now I use it every night," regardless of anxiety (even though it still really helps with that!) Recently it’s gotten some great updates that make the user face easier,  and the ability to play multiple sounds at once is awesome!  Sometimes I use it during the day too,  mixed with my music that you can play after you’ve started up the rain rain sounds on any music app. Use it to give a cozy vibe to a fall day,  or give me calm vibes during stressful times.  There is a paid version,  but I don’t use that because I don’t feel I need to. It has enough at its core,  the add ons are just that,  extra! They are not needed and the app doesn’t shove it down your throat. I also noticed I had some free premium currency I have yet to use,  and might some time.  I wish there was a better night light mode,  I’m not sure how it could be improved but it hasn’t done anything special for me and it’s a cool idea,  but I just don’t think it’s implemented that well.  So thank you developers!

It’s 2009 (approximately) and I am a middle schooler on a family trip with my parents. I (presumably) downloaded this app to drown out my parents on long car rides. I power up the app,  put in ear buds,  and the next thing I know,  we’ve arrived at our destination. I was knocked out,  like so deep in sleep that apparently my head was swinging around and hitting the seat but I didn’t feel a thing. Since then,  this app has been with me through everything. Nights that I have trouble falling asleep,  plane rides,  bus rides,  car rides,  college dorms & college roommates,  snoring parents,  group trips,  etc etc. Absolutely any time I need to tune out the world and fall asleep right away,  I use Rain Rain. Practically on a daily basis for 10 years. I have never written an app review before but I love this app passionately,  like a friend you can’t live without.

Rain Rain’s relaxing and soothing sounds are perfect for anyone and everyone. It even works on babies and can help you sleep like one. I personally like the sounds of winter," so I created a mix of rain and fire. It makes me like like I’m sitting in front of the fire on a cold winters night,  which is when I’m most content. Rain Rain has a wide of sounds,  from a cat purring to a dryer! But that’s not all,  because there are also a few music samples that you can listen to. There is the option of Premium and subscribing,  but is not compulsory,  and even without these you still amazing options! I have slept so well since I got Rain Rain.

Too loud for the phone speakers on most models. Secondly,  the in app volume control controls the main volume. So if you want it quieter,  you’ll lower the main volume,  therefore lowering the volume to your alarm clock. Not smart. And third. A monthly subscription? Again? You know this is mostly automatic and doesn’t cost any where near the price they are asking. This is one time purchase app only. Shouldn’t make you pay a monthly fee ever. Market is over flooded with apps you may or may not use much,  that rips you off by making you pay way over the actual price,  but makes it LOOK cheap by offering that one low cost,  that you pay monthly.

So relaxing! The sounds are realistic. Some rain apps just sound like sizzling bacon. LOL. And the thunder storms are amazing. My favorite is the rain on a car mixed with a thunderstorm. The mixing feature is a great idea. There is even cricket and cicadas sounds. Those personally get to me before too long but,  if you like that,  you’ll love this app. The free features are great on their own but,  I like to support the developers out there that don’t give the impression that they only want money. i.e. most other apps similar to this one want money right away to get the best features. Not this one! It is very affordable if you decide to purchase some extras. So,  I will be purchasing a couple of the sound packs. I look forward to see if new sounds are added. I would really love the sound of a light wind with rustling trees. It reminds me of camping when I was a kid. Which by the way,  the app also has rain on a tent. Get this app!

Rain Rain Sleep Sounds,iOS,Rain Rain Sleep Sounds,iOS,478687481,3600921614,United Kingdom,5.9,5,01/01/2019,Becketybop,All round good.,I don’t usually leave feedback but seeing that I use this app on a day to day basis I thought I might.  I use rain rain to help me drift to sleep. I like that there is a timer which I usually set for 15 minutes (usually does the job  zzzz)  I love that there are different groups ie household noises," birds etc,  nature. And that you can mix any noise to create a  personalised sound for yourself. I don’t pay to use rain rain so I usually just play the usual rain pouring down etc. Sometimes I’ll mix it up abit,  which I can with  various others (free ones) You can listen to one paid noise for free each day but they don’t really vary very much,  they seem to be the same old ones? I think that’s the only thing I’d like to point out.  Actually also (sorry)..new noises could be updated more regularly??   Anyways..  I’d like to say thank you to the app peeps for helping me get a peaceful nights sleep ?? keep going with this app,  it’s great!

I love listening to it rain outside,  and this app has many different variations of free rain sounds.  It has so many different free sounds!  I also love wind chimes,  and when I saw there was a wind chime package I could buy,  I just had to have it.   I love that I can combine sounds for a completed unique sound that I determine.

So," I have tried various ‘white noises’ which I always find More disturbing! I wake up & heat it buzzing away. But this app is absolutely wonderful,  it creates a realistic,  cosy,  comforting atmosphere which just relaxes you to your core. There are many lovely settings & sounds to choose from (I personally like the ‘car in the rain’ sound - which is mellow & consistent). Very clever gesture that u can mix your own favourite sounds. Or select your favourites. Love that it can either stay on all night,  or you can set a dimmer/timer for however long u want. You need flexibility when something is so ‘individual’ a sleep habit - some nights you’ll want it on all night & other,  easy,  just switch ur standard timer on or easily set it for your desired time. As you can tell,  as someone who has trouble with sleep,  I LOVE this app!

Thank you  for this app:) I always have slept great when it rains and fairly normal otherwise I think: sometimes ok," sometimes broken,  sometimes I wake and can’t go back to sleep ( busy mom,  wife,  professional).  After 3 nights of restless,  broken sleep I crawled in with my daughter (to keep from waking my husband again) who had this app running. I slept until morning and woke from a deep delightful sleep that I was so grateful for!!  I have now downloaded it on my phone. Finding the sounds that sooth me was easy ( “Thunder cracks” +“Mississippi at night”:) I can’t wait to try it again! Maybe I’ll even get a successful nap in someday.  Anyhow,  if you find yourself wishing for sleep I recommend you download this app,  Scroll to find the sound ( or add 2 together for a combo- very user friendly) that relaxes you (you know what it is- you’ll remember when you hear it!),  and let it play:)  I can tell you it’s worth a shot. I took the time to write my first review ever to let you know that I would never have tried this on my own- even after it was suggested to me ( too busy,  skeptical) I’m so very glad I had such a great & unexpected experience (Thank you Natalie :))  Good luck & Sweet dreams!",", ",positive,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/96313-rain-rain-sleep-sounds/reviews/895336368/reply,,"""""Audio"""", """"Complexity"""", """"Design & UX"""", """"Performance"""", """"Satisfied users""""]"",","],",]

The sounds included for free are high quality,  looped sounds. You can also set a bedtime reminder or a fade out timer if you’re like me and need white noise to fall asleep.

Not quite as good as Ambien,  but way better than nothing at all! The rain sounds you provide are far better than any dedicated white-noise generators that I have sampled.

I have a couple of different sound apps and they don't even compare to this one. Rain Rain blows them out of the roof!  It actually sounds realistic and there are beautiful pictures. It is organized and I love some of the features.  I will say though,  it does crash a lot. Which should not happen. I realize this has been happening to other people,  and I'm not sure what to do. It will just power my phone off in the middle of the night while playing a sound or close out of the app.  But the sounds are SO realistic. For the Light Snow sound,  when I woke up,  and I for real searched my upstairs for my dog chewing a Lego,  as he does this a lot and the sound is just like hearing a Lego be chewed. ??????",", ",neutral,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/96313-rain-rain-sleep-sounds/reviews/771553461/reply,,"""""Audio"""", """"Bugs"""", """"Camera & Photos"""", """"Design & UX"""", """"Gaming"""", """"Satisfied users""""]"",","],",]

As a result when my iPhone automatically locks after 5 minutes the sounds stop. I noted that the developer claimed this was due to a phone’s “native settings” to another set of feedback reporting the same issue. This is not true. There is no functionality in the settings app to over-ride this behaviour. Other apps such as Spotify and Calm allow background playing.

Maybe,  recordings can be added to the “My Recordings” list chronologically (as we add them)? A search bar could also be helpful.  Regardless,  I love taomix 2 and will continue to use it regularly.

Maybe inside the app you could enter a mode where individual sounds can float around and then designate the left side of the screen as the left channel,  right side as right channel,  etc and the sound will shift from left ear to right ear as the sound approaches the right side of the screen. Or for 5.1 surround system support,  you could also add bottom and top corner sound points to the screen to account for the front left/right/center and rear left/right found in most people’s surround sound systems.

Diane speaks distinctly and slowly which really helped me understand her. She described the program very well,  and it’s just what I need at this point in my life when my hearing is getting really bad. Even my dog won’t stay in the same room with me after I turn the TV volume up so loud!   I’m delighted that I meet the program criteria and look forward to the services you provide.  You have a high performing staff member with Diane so I hope you will do everything you can to keep her on board. We had a good conversation,  and she even laughed at my lame jokes.  It made my day!

Many,  many years later; on an impulsive click to an ad,  I was connected to this service.  The appointment was set up,  the hearing aids sent to the center,  and I had my test.  To begin,  the audiologist Adam Dell was a kind and very considerate man. I recommend his services for all patients.  After taking the test,  I discovered that I am severely hearing impaired,  far worst than I had ever expected. The convenience of having the hearing aids there was exactly what I needed!  Once the pieces were placed in my ears and the sounds were received,  I was so overwhelmed by the new sounds,  that emotions overtook me.  If those hearing aids were not there,  if the services would not have been so convenient,  I probably would have continued on in my silent world.  Thank you,   to all that serviced me today.

Bzzzz! Wrong.  Part of the problem is being interrupted all the time in the free app,  but the GUI will be just as awful in the pro version. Specifically,  when you’re scrubbing the waveform across freqs,  you can shift small amounts with good control,  but take your finger off the screen for any reason,  and when you try to continue from where you left off you can’t because the wave jumps way off from where it had been as soon as you touch it. I suppose I could have constantly watched the readout so I’d know where I’d left off,  but I was trying to concentrate on listening to minute variations in sound. They should have controls that let you move set amounts so it’s not so frustrating.

Unfortunately midway through night two my mind picked up on the loop point in the white & pink noise audio recordings and then that was basically jarring me up every time it cycled through (roughly :30 - a minute) and it could not be EQ’d out / away. Longer,  more seemless loops and the ability to stagger start points of samples would help in solving this problem. As would the ability to use eq notching on outside sources and or upload ones owns sounds at a length that would be less detectable by those with sensitive ears and sleep lightly. Or even an actual noise generator in sound suites. Thank you for the almost life saving app! Please consider adding something like this or a standalone notching app for all us struggling with sleep / tinnitus.",", ",neutral,,English,,https://app.appbot.co/apps/1028464-tinnitus-hq-ear-ringing-relief/reviews/2510709603/reply,,"""""Audio"""", """"Bugs"""", """"Design & UX"""", """"Frequency"""", """"Satisfied users"""", """"Customer Support""""]"",","],",]

Nice," simple user interface to create ‘notch’ and mix different sound files together. Extensive library of sound files to select from to create custom library. As for effectiveness in reducing perception of tinnitus,  only time will tell.  After a few days of use,  I have one recommendation for the developer. Setting the frequency of the notch could be improved significantly by adding “+” and “-“ buttons to the current ‘slider’ control.  This would allow precise setting of the tinnitus frequency. Also,  adding similar “+/-“ controls to files in a mix would provide better balancing in a mix.  Great,  economical app!
